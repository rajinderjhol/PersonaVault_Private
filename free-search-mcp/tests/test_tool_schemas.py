"""Wire-shape pins for the MCP tool surface.

These tests exist to make an SDK upgrade a *visible* diff instead of a silent
one. Nothing in `server.py` declares an output schema by hand — the SDK derives
one from each tool's return annotation and, for unions/lists/scalars, wraps the
payload in ``{"result": ...}``. That is emergent behavior nobody asked for, and
from protocol revision 2026-07-28 onward the SDK *validates* returns against
those derived schemas, so a change in derivation rules turns into a tool error
at call time rather than a test failure at build time.

So: assert the shapes here, and let the migration prove it kept them.

The SDK-plumbing differences between protocol eras are confined to
``call_tool()`` below — every assertion in this file is written against the
protocol-level shape, not against the Python return type of the day.
